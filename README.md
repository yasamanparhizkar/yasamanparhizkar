## What I do



----------------


I am a data sceintist at RBC Security Insights and AI, working under Faezeh Khabbaz. Currently, I'm working on graph-based data science, including community detection, graph classficiation, edge classification with partial heterogenous and potentially dynamic data.
Currently, I create solutions for challenging fraud detection problems. My preferred method currently is graph analysis, working with heterogeneuos dynamic graphs and incomplete data.
I explore methods such as graph classification, community detection and signal imputation.
I read text books, papers and technical whitepapers to craft a mathematical formula of my proposed solution. Then I find the best tool to implement it (typically a python package), code and evaluate it, get feedback and repeat.

On the other hand, I'm helping one of my friends hold great classes for technical interview preparation as a kind of community-driven work.

On the third hand, I'm upskilling in new domains. Since I've been quite math and science focused, I'm learning a bit of app development and more engineering work. I've already worked on DevOps and LLM deployment and LLM experiment monitoring and python app development. I'm just learning front-end and back-end development a bit. I love the open source culture, it's amazing to me that solely based on community power (no money, no leadership) such amazing software could be crafted. I hope to see more of this culture in areas beyond software, such as other fields of science, art, engineering, robotics, etc.

I attend hackathons on the side whenever I can, to meet great people and learn from them. I also get to play with new tech in hackathons and get feedback from good judges which is precious to me.

I have a passion to understand information processing at every level of technology and nature. (this is a bit too abasttract, perhaps keep it for a blog.)

Before RBC, I was working at Vector Institute with Arash and Elham. I contributed to training and evaluation of multimodal transformers for health applications; for example, contrastive learning on pairs of image-text of x-ray images and their reports of pathology images and explanations. After encoding pairs of image-text, we performed image/text retrieval based on a give text/image prompt, visual question answering, and classifications.
Moreover, I was a technical facilitator at a bootcamp about diffusion models for tabular and time-series data, working with Sana and Omar. I prepared tutorial material for the TabSyn model and helped two teams during the whole bootcamp with their technical queries.

I breifly worked for Anchor Automation to upsample 3D point-cloud data using deep learning.

I completed my master's degree at York University. My thesis was about a new graph-based semi-supervised video classification method which we applied to neuronal data and predicted the activity of a salamandar's retina to natrual scenes. You can read our paper here, and see the code here.
